##TODO
- Decide on what kinds of labs we want to incorporate into d0003e
- Make a streamlined process for both windows and linux (and possibly mac?) on how to run code on arty without having to go through synthesisand shit through vivado
- Make a lab specific datasheet/addon to the ordinary datasheet
- Add a screen to arty. Either spi or through the standard connectors on the fpga(dont remember the name of those). 
- Evaluate how hard it would be for a student to use this screen in the current format, is a library needed? (Note i personally believe it was a very good exercise to be forced to look through the datasheets for the registers that corresponded to each of the segments)
